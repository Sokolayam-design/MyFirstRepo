BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT MYSELF - I'm a relationship manager at a commercial bank who's equally passionate about finance and filmmaking. By day, I help businesses grow through strategic financial solutions. By night, I channel my creativity into storytelling through film. I believe both fields share a common threadâ€”transforming visions into reality, whether through numbers or narratives. My unique blend of analytical thinking and artistic expression allows me to approach challenges with both precision and imagination.
